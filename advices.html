    <h2>Drug Interactions: What You Need to Know</h2>

     <br>
    <p id="p1"><b>What Are Drug Interactions?</b><br> <br>When a medication works right, it boosts your health or helps you feel better. But a drug can bring on problems if it doesn't mix well with something else you put into your body, like another medication, a certain food, or alcohol.
          When that happens, it's called a drug interaction. It could make your medication stop working, become less effective, or too strong. It could also trigger side effects.A drug interaction is a reaction between two (or more) drugs or between a drug and a food, beverage, or supplement. Taking a drug while having certain medical conditions can also cause a drug interaction.A drug interaction can affect how a drug works or cause unwanted side effects.

          <p><b>What Are the 3 Types of Drug Interactions?</b><br><br>The main types are:<br><br>
          <b> Drug-drug interaction.</b> This is when a medication reacts with one or more other drugs. For example, taking a cough medicine (antitussive) and a drug to help you sleep (sedative) could cause the two medications to affect each other.
            
            <br><b>Drug-food/drink interaction.</b> This is when something you eat or drink affects a drug. For instance, it can be dangerous to drink alcohol while you're on certain medications. Some vitamins and dietary supplements interact with medicines, too.
            
           <br><b>Drug-condition interaction.</b> This is when you have a health problem that makes it risky for you to take certain meds. For example, if you have a condition like high blood pressure, taking a decongestant for a cold could drive up your blood pressure even more.</p>
