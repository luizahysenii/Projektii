            <p>Well-being, or wellbeing,also known as wellness, prudential value, prosperity or quality of
               life, is what is intrinsically valuable relative to someone. So the well-being of a person is 
               what is ultimately good for this person, what is in the self-interest of this person.
               Well-being can refer to both positive and negative well-being. In its positive sense, it is
               sometimes contrasted with ill-being as its opposite.The meaning of<b> WELL-BEING </b> the state of
               being happy, healthy, or prosperous : welfare.</p>

        <p>You have a lot of say-so in how you feel as you grow older -- from your heart and eyes to your skin and bones.
           You can enjoy a better body by knowing what’s natural as you age and what’s not and by learning simple steps you can try to delay or lessen the changes.<br>
           <b>Your Heart Works Harder</b>
           As you get older, your blood vessels and arteries become stiffer. Your heart has to work harder to pump blood. This can lead to high blood pressure and other heart problems.
           
           Try this: Stay active. Walk, run, swim -- even a little moderate exercise each day can help you stay at a good weight and keep your blood pressure down.<br>  <b>Skin Feels Different</b>
           You might notice that your skin feels drier and less supple than it once did. That’s because your skin makes less natural oil as you ageTry this: Hot water dries skin out, so take warm baths and showers.<br>

          <b> You Find It Harder to See and Hear </b>
           You may find it hard to focus on objects up close. You might need reading glasses for the first time. Perhaps you see more glare or find it hard to adapt to abrupt changes of light.
           When it comes to your hearing, you could have a hard time following conversations in a crowded room or hearing at high frequencies.
           Try this: Get your vision and hearing checked regularly. Wear sunglasses to protect your eyes outdoors. Wear earplugs to protect against or block loud noises.        </p>

        <p id="para1"> <b>1. Amp up your workout-</b> Any kind of aerobic exercise, whether you're running or doing Zumba, burns calories. Make it more intense, and your body will burn more calories.<br>
           <b>2. Lift weights-</b>Because muscle uses more calories than fat, strengthening your muscles will make you into a more efficient calorie-burning machine, even when you're at rest.

           -You'll be doing more than just helping your metabolism. Your heart, bones, and even your mood will benefit.<br><b> It's a win all around.</b>
           Your heart is a muscle, and it gets stronger and healthier if you lead an active life. It's never too late to start exercising, and you don't have to be an athlete. Even taking a brisk walk for 30 minutes a day can make a big difference.

           Once you get going, you'll find it pays off. People who don't exercise are almost twice as likely to get heart disease as people who are active.

            <p>If you're considering having a baby, you probably have wondered how long it will take to get 
            pregnant, when to have sex, and how often. Find the answers to your questions <b>

            <p><b>First Trimester of Pregnancy</b></p>
               <p> The first trimester is the earliest phase of pregnancy. It starts on the first day of your last period,before you’re even actually pregnant, and lasts until the end of the 13th week. It’s a time of great anticipation and of rapid changes for both you and your baby. Knowing what to expect will help you get ready for the months ahead.

            <p><b>Second Trimester of Pregnancy</b></p>   
            <p>The second trimester of your pregnancy lasts from week 13 to 28, or months 4, 5, and 6. It’s the middle phase of pregnancy, when you may start to see your “baby bump” and feel your baby move for the first time.
                As you enter your second trimester of pregnancy, the morning sickness and fatigue you may have felt during the last 3 months should fade.
                The second trimester is, for many women, the easiest 3 months of pregnancy. Take the time now, while you're feeling better and your energy is up, to start planning for your baby's arrival.
                During the second trimester, your baby is growing quickly. Between your 18th and 22nd week of pregnancy you'll have an ultrasound so your doctor can see how your baby is progressing. You also can learn the sex of your baby, unless you'd rather be surprised. And if you’re having twins, you might find that out during this trimester.

            <p><b>Third Trimester</b></p>    
            <p>The third trimester is the last phase of your pregnancy. It lasts from weeks 29 to 40, or months 7, 8, and 9. During this trimester, your baby grows, develops, and starts to change position to get ready for birth.In the third trimester, your baby keeps growing. By the end, a full-term baby usually is between 19 and 21 inches long and between 6 and 9 pounds.
               Your baby begins to turn itself head-down to get ready for delivery. At week 36, the baby’s head should begin to move into your pelvic area, also called lightening. It will stay in this down-facing position for the last 2 weeks of your pregnancy.</p>
               <p>Your baby develops in other important ways in the third trimester.<br> During this phase, it’s able to:</p>
               <ul>
                <li>Open its eyes and see</li>
                <li>Hear</li>
                <li>Suck on its thumb</li>
